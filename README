ESplit.pm

  This Perl module provides one function, e_split(), for splitting strings
  at arbitrary character(sequence)s (the delimiter). Delimiter may be given
  as regex.

USAGE

      my @tokens    = e_split ('::', $source_string, 5);

  returns the first four tokens, delimited by '::', plus the remainder of
  $source_string ($tokens[-1]).

      my $token_ref = e_split ('::', $source_string, -7);

  returns the last six tokens, delimited by '::', plus the remainder
  (beginning) $source_string ($token_ref->[0]), plus the delimiters matched.
  Result is returned as a reference to the token-array.

- delimiters contained in quoted tokens will be ignored, as are backslash-
  escaped delims.
- delimiters given in () are returned as n + 1st elements of
  the resulting array (CORE::split()-like).
- the maximum number of tokens to be returned can be passed, counted from
  beginning (CORE::split()-like) or from the end of $source_string.


DISCUSSION

  e_split() vs. Text::QuoteWords::parse_line():

  e_split is 2-5 times faster than als Text::ParseWords::parse_line.
  e_split deals well with quotes within unquoted tokens.
  e_split is more robust at mixed-quotes tokens.
